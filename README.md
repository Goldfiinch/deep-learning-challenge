# deep-learning-challenge
Report:
- Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
  - The analysis involves creating & training a neural network keras model to determine whether applications will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. 
- Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:
-   Data Preprocessing
    - What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
      - The target variables are y_train & y_test, which include the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column from the DataFrame. 
    - What variable(s) are the features of your model?
      - The features variables are X_train & X_test, which include all other columns in the DataFrame that act as features.
    - What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
  
-   Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
    - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
    - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
    - What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
  
- Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
